This was just a proof of concept for https://gats.io
Since they added recaptcha and i wont invest money just to improve the game i ditch that and release the code.

I've ran this in a repl.it environment. (Thats what the .replit file is for)

The cool thing is, i compiled the library for browser aswell, so i could use it in a tampermoney script.
I could just require the compiled lib from this repl.it's public folder.
Cool huh? :^)
